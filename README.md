# Machine Learning
This repository contains the project of the lecture machine learning of the cooperative state university Stuttgart. The
goal is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image processing. In this project a data set with different
emotions of faces in the shape of 80x80 pixels will be trained. The data are from
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmirfan/micro-expressions>.
